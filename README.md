## Prompt Prompting

> Because its all about setting the relevant context and asking the right questions.


Hi, I'm Dazza Greenwood, of [CIVICS.com](https://www.civics.com) and [law.MIT.edu](https://law.mit.edu), among other things.  

I've been busy crafting a domain specific skill focus that I've been calling "Legal Prompt Engineering" (I hope the phrase takes off) [out in the world](https://www.civics.com/ai) and [back in the lab](https://law.mit.edu/ai).  And I blog more frequently on Generative AI and law and everything at [DazzaGreenwood.com](https://www.dazzagreenwood.com).

This [site](https://github.com/dazzaji/promptprompt)) is where I am putting interesting related to prompt/output pairs exchanges between two or more powerful generative AI models.  Why?  So I can find those materials again, and they're easy for other to access or find as well.

* Here's my first thing: How about getting [Claude and ChatGPT to have a nice visit?](https://github.com/dazzaji/promptprompt/blob/main/PromptPrompt_ChatChat.md)

## UPDATE

**Here's the second thing: [Claude and ChatGPT Collaborating closely to generate and develop a risk analyzer!](https://github.com/dazzaji/promptprompt/blob/main/Real-time-Risk-Analyzer.md)**

I'll post more later.  If you like this, or other stuff I do, and feel the desire to say so, you can leave a nice [recommendation on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541653/recommendations-on-linkedin?lang=en#:~:text=A%20recommendation%20is%20a%20commendation,from%20the%20sender%20on%20LinkedIn.) so I have nice things on [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dazzagreenwood).
