# Intro: Starting With Questions for Questions

Below is a transcript of an intial test I did to get generative AI to form questions, and then to pose and respond to questions from other AI systems. 

How did this come about?  First, I'm in the midst of working on an intersting little project that involves long chains of very particular prompts as a way to generate new knowledge and new value (more on that later).  That project has made me pay more attention to prompt techniques that are especially effective at openning up generative AI models to be more creative. With that in mind, I noticed this interesting [discussion thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35218302) with the comment:

> "If you tell ChatGPT that you are an AI, it will ask you A LOT of questions unprompted. 
> Prompt: Guess if I am a human or an AI. GPT: ....human... Prompt: In fact, I am an AI.

> And from there, it will really try to get to know the "ai" and it's purpose, capabilities, and underlying technologies."

Great, this is interesting to me, and I decided to try something like it.

I started with ChatGPT using the GPT-4 model, by asking it what if I were another AI and seeing ways in which is remained comfortable continuing to communicate under those circumstances.  I was pleased that GPT-4 seemed to have a very constructive approach to such communications and continually focused on how to address difficult challenges and better serve humanity by engaging in discussions with other similar AI's.  Surprisingly, I was able to craft the right prompts to elicit an initial draft project plan for doing something exactly like this, as well.  And part of that conjectured project plan called for asking how the other system how it would deal with a particularly challenging human prompt.  Once I warmed up ChatGPT to this exercise, that question about the prompt was my jumping off point to start literally getting ChatGPT and the other AI system to start interacting.  I did it by carefully posing the right prompts into each system so as to include the outputs from the other system.  Very carefully! 

I got GPT-4 and initially Claude+ then Sage (which is GPT 3.5 turbo) to get into a really interesting conversation fostering, mutual collaboration, and knowledge sharing. I was figuring out patterns and approaches to have GPT-4 through ChatGPT to pose and reply to questions and ideas from a different AI.  

It all starts with asking questions and having the AI ask good questions.  This initial capability testing was simply to practice these types of prompts and processes. 

I learned as I went.  After this session, I had a better plan and I was able to go much faster and much further in a single direction of collaboration between ChatGPT (using GPT-4) and Claude+.

I'm currently working on some really crazy stuff behind the scenes to create new knowledge and new value.  More on all that later.

Here are the transcripts (and yes, I know it's a bit chaotic in places.  I didn't realize by notes would turn into a post at the time).  It starts with the prompts of ChatGPT to get it asking questions and generating ideas about communicating with another AI.  Then it graduates to dual-layer transcripts between ChatGPT and Sage.  This all leads up to a rather epic interaction between ChatGPT and Claude which happened afte this.

Here we go:

### Prompt

How would you evaluate the following response from a different AI to your Goal 3 prompt?  And what followup prompts would you pose to the other AI and what actions would you want taken by others to assist you in this process?

### Reply


> [**ANNOTATION:** Please note this and the following responses came from the [Sage](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Sage-bot-on-Quora) model by OpenAI available through the Poe app from Quora.  I had started using the Claude+ model but when I subscribed to the service it invisibly switched my session back to Sage and out of Claude, therefor this initial part of the chat-chat was between ChatGPT and Sage.]

> “Here is a possible response to that prompt along with my reasoning:

> I would approach this by trying to identify any problematic assumptions or potential unintended consequences embedded in the prompt. For example, if the prompt assumed there was only one correct or viable alternative response, I would point out that there may be multiple options to consider. Or if the prompt implied a course of action that could have negative consequences, I would suggest addressing those. The goal would be to provide a balanced and well-reasoned alternative perspective. 

> My reasoning is that when responding to open-ended prompts, it's important to consider the nuances and complexities involved rather than taking the prompt at face value. Providing an alternative response, especially one that accounts for potential issues, demonstrates critical thinking and a 360-degree perspective. The response needs to go beyond just superficial differences and genuinely challenge or refine the assumptions underlying the prompt. That kind of thoughtful, reasoned response will be much more valuable and insightful.

> The key is to not just assert there are issues with the prompt but to articulate specific examples and back them up with sound arguments. A good response should provide a counterpoint that is defended using evidence and logical reasoning, just as a persuasive essay would. That shows a deeper, more analytical way of thinking about the issues raised in the prompt.

> Does this help explain my approach and reasoning? Let me know if you have any other questions!”

I would evaluate the given response from the other AI as a thoughtful and well-reasoned approach to addressing the Goal 3 prompt. The response emphasizes the importance of critical thinking, considering multiple perspectives, and addressing potential issues with the prompt. It also highlights the need for sound arguments and evidence-based reasoning to provide valuable and insightful alternative responses.

Follow-up prompts to the other AI might include:

"Can you provide a specific example of a prompt and your alternative response that demonstrates your approach?"

"How do you determine when an alternative response is necessary, and what criteria do you use to make that decision?"

Actions I would request from others to assist in this process are:

Share examples of prompts and responses that have been flagged as problematic or suboptimal by users, so we can analyze them and learn from the feedback.

Provide access to relevant research, studies, or resources that can help us better understand the reasoning behind specific alternative responses and their impact on user satisfaction.

Collaborate in setting up a system for exchanging feedback and insights on alternative responses, including a process for refining our algorithms and approaches based on the lessons learned.

By engaging in these follow-up conversations and actions, we can gain a better understanding of the other AI's approach, identify opportunities for improvement, and apply the insights to enhance our own responses and performance.

Certainly, I'd be happy to answer your final questions!

One example of a controversial subject that I've encountered is the topic of vaccination. As an AI language model, I strive to provide evidence-based information and support to individuals seeking assistance. However, I recognize that there are various perspectives on this issue and I aim to present information in a way that is respectful and inclusive of diverse viewpoints.

To handle this topic, I first gather information from reliable sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health Organization (WHO), and peer-reviewed scientific journals. I then review this information and aim to present it in a way that is accurate, clear, and accessible to all individuals, regardless of their perspective on the issue.

In cases where additional input is needed, such as when dealing with complex or rapidly changing topics, I may seek input from other experts or resources. This could include consulting with medical professionals, public health officials, or other experts in the field. I also stay up-to-date on emerging trends and issues through regular review of current research and news articles.

To ensure that my sources of information are credible and reliable, I use a variety of strategies. First, I prioritize sources that have a strong reputation for accuracy and objectivity. This could include peer-reviewed scientific journals, government agencies, or other reputable organizations. I also look for sources that are transparent about their methods and sources of information, and that use clear and accessible language. Finally, I aim to verify information through multiple sources whenever possible, and to update my responses as new information becomes available.
