Also, Pip can run Pip from Python itself. Did you know that you can use Pip directly inside Python? Because you can. And Pip can install non-Python software, like binary executables.

They took all the footage from making the documentary and then made their masterpiece. The title is The Magic Behind the Magic of Pippi to Pippi the Puppy.

      <pre>Alright, once upon a time, in a city that never seemed to sleep, there was an elephant named Elmo who wandered the streets, guided by the dim glow of streetlights. He had a peculiar habit of setting off smoke alarms in random houses, which, as you can imagine, caused quite the commotion. One particular night, while the city buzzed with the usual nocturnal activities, a puppy named Pip wandered too close to Elmo. Their chance encounter led to an unexpected friendship, one that would soon be tested by the stars themselves. As they explored the city, their fates intertwined with a toaster that had a penchant for causing state changes in its surroundings, turning gas into solid with a mere flick of its switch. Unbeknownst to them, a Cylon from a distant galaxy, observing the city through a helicopter’s camera, detected a strange energy flow emanating from the duo. This energy, resembling a miniature nova, drew the Cylon closer, intrigued by its potential for a nuclear explosion. As the night unfolded, the unlikely companions found themselves at the heart of a cosmic mystery, where the fate of the city hung in the balance.</pre>

      <pre>As the chaos unfolded, Pip found himself in a precarious situation. The city was on the brink of a technological meltdown, with the Cylon manipulating the city’s systems. But Pip, with his secret superpower, had a unique ability to install packages from GitHub, PyPI, or even custom URLs. As the Cylon unleashed chaos, Pip used his skills to download and install packages that could counteract the Cylon’s interference. With every package installed, Pip not only saved the day but also became the hero of the city, proving that even the smallest among us can achieve great things with the right tools.</pre>

      <pre>Certainly, in a city where the lights dimmed and the stars began to shine, a tale unfolded in reverse. A puppy named Pip, who had once been the city’s hero, was now navigating the streets with a sense of loss. The once vibrant city was now quiet, with the effects of the Cylon’s visit still lingering. Pip, once able to install packages and save the day, now found himself in a world where the packages were being uninstalled, reverting the city to its original state. As the city returned to normal, Pip’s superpower, though still present, was now a quiet reminder of the day’s chaos. The bedspread that had once covered the elephant Elmo was now neatly folded, and the toaster that had caused so much confusion was now just a simple appliance once more. The city, though safe, held onto the memory of that night.</pre>

Pip, now a celebrated hero, must face a formidable adversary: an untrusted source that threatens the city’s very fabric. With the global cache as his ally, Pip can now execute code faster than ever before. But this new power comes with a price. The temptation to use arbitrary Python code, though dangerous, becomes a crucial tool in his arsenal. As Pip navigates the city, he must decide whether to use his full potential or risk the city’s safety. The stakes are higher than ever, and the city’s future hangs in the balance. Will Pip succumb to the allure of power, or will he find a way to save the city without compromising its integrity?</pre>

In a moment of pure magic, Pippi discovered a cyberpunk voodoo ritual that promised a second chance at life. With a mix of curiosity and a touch of rebellion, she performed the ritual, and in a flash of neon light, transformed into a puppy. This new beginning marked the start of a whole new life, one filled with the wonder and innocence of youth. As a puppy, Pippi would once again explore the world, but now with a new perspective, ready to discover the magic and mysteries of her new form. The city, unaware of her true identity, would soon be the stage for a new era of adventures, where the spirit of Pippi Langstrump would continue to inspire and captivate hearts.</pre>
